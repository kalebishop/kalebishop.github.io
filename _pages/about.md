## about me
I'm a current Computer Science PhD student at CU Boulder working in the [CAIRO](http://cairo-lab.com/) group.

Before starting my PhD program, I got my B.S. in Cognitive Science from Yale University. As a first-generation student from a low-income background, I'm personally passionate about addressing educational inequality and making scientific research accessible and inclusive to all.

My preferred pronouns are they/them, but any are fine by me. I publish under the name *Kayleigh Bishop*, but most people call me *Kaleb*.

## my research
I study AI & robotics, and specifically how they can draw inspiration from cognitive science to better serve their users' needs. My current focus is on how AI can support task handover and decision-making in fast-paced fields like nursing and manufacturing.

I am interested in researching embodied computational models of human behavior, especially perceptual, linguistic, and social skills. Using knowledge of how humans perceive and operate on the world and the social beings around them can inform the creation of more intelligent, adaptive, and communicative systems. I am particularly interested in the potential application of these skills in the creation of socially assistive robotics and cognitively supportive AI systems. My other interests include human-robot interaction, natural language processing, artificial intelligence, and tech-related public policy.

## contact me
I'm always looking to connect with new people! Whether you're a member of the robotics/AI or CogSci community or you're just curious about what I do, please feel free to email me at kaleb.bishop\[at\]colorado.edu.
