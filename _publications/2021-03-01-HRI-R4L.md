This proposal outlines the case for the use of social robots in teaching grounded reading skills in early childhood education. Given what we know about how students learn to read, combined with the power of robots as triggers for sensorimotor and socio-pedagogical engagement, we argue that an autonomous robot reading partner could be a powerful teaching tool during this critical phase of learning.
