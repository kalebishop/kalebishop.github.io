In this paper we propose a preliminary design for a flexible natural language interface for a task assignment system. The goal of our approach is both to grant users more control over a task assignment systemâ€™s decision process, as well as render these decisions more transparent. Users can direct the task assignment system via natural language commands, which are applied as constraints to a mixed-integer linear program (MILP) using a large language model (LLM). Additionally, our proposed system can alert users to potential issues with their commands, and engage them in a corrective dialogue in order to find a viable solution.
